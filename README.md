WARNING: UNSTABLE CODE - INCOMPLETE AND DEVELOPMENT QUALITY ONLY

GX is an experiment that aims to provide a GS-Style interface to wxErlang, the Erlang port of wxWidgets. 

This second prototype talks directly to the wxe_driver without relying on the generated wx application code. 

Generated headers for driver argument identifiers are imported from wx; but gx 0.4 no longer uses the generated wx modules.

The earlier prototype, gx 0.3.0, is tagged in this repo.

The license for gx has been changed to apache 2.0 rather than creative commons.
